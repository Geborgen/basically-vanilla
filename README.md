## Preamble
This is literally vanilla Skyrim but it looks and runs a bit nicer. Not a whole lot to say here. No gameplay changes. Graphics consist of Cathedral Weathers, Project Clarity, Cathedral mods, and basic LOD. No ENB or ReShade is included but you can add it yourself. A bunch of fixes. Oh and Untarnished UI because it's so cool. And some new animations. I made this for a friend mainly but it's good if you just want a slightly better vanilla.

## System Requirements
if u can run skyrim u can run this

the whole list is 69.2 gb, 51 without downloads

## Installation
- Create a folder at the root of your drive called `Basically Vanilla` (like `C:/Basically Vanilla`)
- Download Wabbajack from [here](https://www.wabbajack.org/) and add it to a folder at the ROOT of your drive (like `C:/Wabbajack`)
- Download the .wabbajack file from this repository and place in your Wabbajack folder, and run it
- Set your installation folder to your `Basically Vanilla` folder
- If your downloads folder is not set automatically, set it to `Basically Vanilla/downloads`
- Click the start button to begin, and follow the prompts on-screen
- Wait. If you get an error see below, otherwise proceed to [the next section](#post-installation)

### Problems with Installation
- Could not download x:
  - Big files can fail to download due to connection issues. You can either run Wabbajack again or download the file manually. If you decide to manually download it, make sure to place it in the same place as the other downloads (`Basically Vanilla\downloads`). For this list, it should absolutely not be an issue.
- x is not a whitelisted download:
  - This may happen when I update the list. Please check if there is a new update or wait if there is none.
- Wabbajack could not find my game folder:
  - You will never get support for a pirated copy of the game. Either buy the game *on Steam* or, if you did, go back to the [Installation](#installation) step.
- Antivirus reports a virus:
  - Windows 10/11 may automatically quarantine a key file that is needed for MO2. You can fix this by [adding an exclusion for MO2 in windows defender](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/exclude-a-folder-from-windows-security-scan).
  
 ## Post Installation
 - Run `ModOrganizer.exe` and then click `Run` at the top right to play the list
 - There will be a prompt to skip the intro if you want, if you do then you will spawn at the end of the Helgen cave

## Everything Else
 
there is no enb feel free to add it if you want

it used stock game so the game directory is `Basically Vanilla/Stock Game`
 
idc if you modify the list its literally the most basic thing

to uninstall just delete the `Basically Vanilla` folder
 
i probably wont update this
 
dont submit bug reports theres nothing i will do and they are probably vanilla bugs anyway

thanks to wabbajack ofc and carson for making me make this

(its actually pretty fun i forgot how much i loved vanilla skyrim)
